**Outlier Handling Analysis**

This is a short analysis that helps to understand various ways of handling an outlier using techniques such as:

* Winsorization
* Trimming
* IQR Score method
* Replacement by mean
* Log Tranformation method

Hence, after the analysis, skewness score was used to evaluate the results and hence recommendations were made.
